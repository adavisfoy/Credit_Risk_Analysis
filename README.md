# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
Explain the purpose of this analysis.

## Results: 
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models.

Measuring "Precision" gives us the ability to say whether or not our predicated positive observations actually were positive observations. Precision takes into account both testing and training data (???).  
Measuring "Recall" helps us evaluate whether or not we are missing out on other positive observations (e.g. false negatives). Recall only takes into account our predicated values (???).

## Summary: 
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. 
If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
